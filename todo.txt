DataMigrator:
- improve metadata for migrated and migrationSequence for richer progress messages.
- Check for duplicate migration numbers
- add description to migration attribute (for usage in log)
- lock DataPointVersions.cfg while migrating
- allow all migrations to do a precondition check before the migration sequence is started 
- allow querying migrationsequence properties before migrating
- instantiate datapoint and migrations through DI container?
- let DataMigrator do pre-migration setup of all datapointmigrator migration sequences (to make sure all preconditions are meet before attempting any migration)
